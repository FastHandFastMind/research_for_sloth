TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress on Thursday to address the U.S. government's recent aggressive posture toward the company. Chew reassured the government that the company would safeguard the safety of minors, bolster its privacy and security practices, and ward off any possibility of “unauthorized foreign access” to U.S. user data. He also argued that TikTok has never shared data on U.S. users with the Chinese government nor has it ever received a request to do so. During the hearing, lawmakers from both political parties pressed Chew for answers about the company’s relationship with China, its failure to moderate disturbing content, and its plans to build trust in the U.S., its biggest market. Chew was also questioned about the company's impact on young users, its data privacy practices, and an incident in which ByteDance employees surveilled U.S. citizens through TikTok. Additionally, the committee discussed TikTok's recent campaign to self-regulate, known as Project Texas, and its partnership with Oracle to shift U.S. data onto U.S.-based servers. Despite the aggressive questioning from the committee, Chew was able to maintain a friendly demeanor and the hearing ended without any major decisions being made."

OpenAI's ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that has gone viral. Today, OpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT which allow it to access third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. The most intriguing plugin is OpenAI’s first-party web-browsing plugin, which allows ChatGPT to draw data from around the web to answer questions. The plugin retrieves content from the web using the Bing search API and shows any websites it visited in crafting an answer, citing its sources in ChatGPT’s responses. There is a risk of the chatbot quoting from unreliable sources and going off the rails, delving into conspiracy theories and offensive content when prompted with certain text. OpenAI has implemented safeguards to prevent this, and has open sourced a “retrieval” plugin that enables ChatGPT to access snippets of documents from data sources like files, notes, emails or public documentation by asking questions in natural language. Plugins are a curious addition to the timeline of ChatGPT’s development, as they allow companies to retain full control over their data."

Accenture, a tech consultancy giant, is cutting 19,000 jobs, or 2.5% of its workforce, and has lowered its annual revenue and profit forecasts due to global economic conditions. The job cuts will occur over the next 18 months, with over half of them being in non-billable corporate functions. The company also noted that voluntary attrition was 12% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, down from 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Accenture’s annual revenue growth for the fiscal 2023 is now expected to be between 8% to 10%, down from 8% to 11%. The company attributed the lower growth to economic conditions such as macroeconomic conditions, overall inflationary environment, and levels of business confidence. Additionally, economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world has impacted and may continue to impact their business."
