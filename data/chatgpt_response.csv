"OpenAI has released GPT-4, a large multimodal AI model that can accept image and text inputs and generate text outputs with human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks. It is capable of handling nuanced instructions, is proficient in multiple languages, and can accept both text and image inputs. OpenAI has been working on the plan of defining the behavior of AIs, including steerability, so developers can customize usersâ€™ experiences. Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 is not perfect and can still make errors in reasoning, accept false statements as true, and fail at challenging problems. OpenAI is working to mitigate the risks associated with GPT-4, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information, by engaging with experts and collecting additional data. GPT-4 is now available in ChatGPT and Bing with a usage limit, and users can sign up for the waitlist to access the GPT-4 API."
"GPT-4 is the latest language model created by OpenAI that is more advanced than the current version, GPT-3.5. GPT-4 is currently only available in the ChatGPT Plus paid subscription and as an API for developers to build applications and services. It is also available in Bing Chat, but some features are missing from Bing Chat such as visual input. GPT-4 is more advanced in three key areas: creativity, visual input, and longer context. It is also significantly safer to use than the previous generation, producing 40% more factual responses and being 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that GPT-4 is more of an evolution than a revolution, and that it is unlikely to cause a shock to the world."
