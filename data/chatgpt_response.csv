"Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski have dedicated the upcoming John Wick 4 movie to the late Lance Reddick, who passed away at age 60. Reddick was an actor who had starred in films like John Wick, TV series such as Fringe and The Wire, animated series like The Legend Of Vox Machina and video games like Horizon Zero Dawn and Destiny 2. He was beloved by many and was a joy to work with. His death has caused an outpouring of grief and mourning.

Reeves and Stahelski said in a statement, “We are deeply saddened and heartbroken at the loss of our beloved friend and colleague Lance Reddick. He was the consummate professional and a joy to work with. Our love and prayers are with his wife Stephanie, his children, family, and friends. We dedicate the film to his loving memory. We will miss him dearly.”

The world of Wick would not be what it is without Lance Reddick and the unparalleled depth he brought to Charon's humanity and unflappable charisma. Reddick recently played the dragon Thordack in the second season of The Legend Of Vox Machina, where his powerful voice gave life to a terrifying new villain. In this and in so many other franchises, his passing leaves a gaping hole.

Reeves spoke highly of Reddick, telling Vulture in an interview in 2021, ""On one hand I feel like I don't know him very well but on the other, I just adore that guy. He's such a wonderful human being.” Reddick was far too young to be taken from this world, and his passing is a reminder to us all to never take life for granted."
